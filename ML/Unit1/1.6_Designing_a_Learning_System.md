## Designing a learning system
A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P,\
if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.

Suppose we want to design a system for Checkers learning problem

## Checkers learning problem:
**Task T** -> Playing checkers\
**Performance Measure P** -> % of games won against opponents.\
**Training Experience E** ->playing practice game against itself.

**we will be able to decide the following three key components:***

- Choosing the Target Function
- Choosing a representation for the Target Function
- Choosing an approximation algorithm for the Target Function
  
## Choose Target Function
Let's take the example of a checkers-playing program that can generate the legal moves (M) from any board state (B). The program needs only to learn how to choose the best move from among these legal moves

```python
V(b): B -> M
```

Here, B denotes the set of board states and M denotes the set of legal moves given a board state. 

## Choose the Representation of Target Function

We need to choose a representation that the learning algorithm will use to describe the function NextMove. The function NextMove will be calculated as a linear combination of the following board features:

## Choose a Function Approximation Algorithm

To learn the target function NextMove, we require a set of training examples, each describing a specific board state b and the training value (Correct Move ) y for b.
