## Reinforcement Learning
Its all about making decisions sequentially.

In simple words we can say that the output depends on the state of the current input and the next input depends on the output of the previous input.

Reinforcement learning is a type of machine learning in which a computer learns to perform a task through repeated trial-and-error interactions with a dynamic environment

In Reinforcement Learning we learn about state, reward, action, agent,environment.

## More theory points
1. takes inspiration from how human beings learn from data in their lives
2. It features an algorithm that improves upon itself.
3. Favorable outputs are encouraged or ‘reinforced’, and non-favorable outputs are discouraged or ‘punished’.
4. When it comes to reinforcement learning the first application which comes to your mind is AI playing games. 

## Applications

### Manufacturing
We already know how useful robots are in the industrial and manufacturing areas. But now these robots are made much more powerful by leveraging reinforcement learning.

 ### Trading
 Stock Market Trading has been one of the hottest areas where reinforcement learning can be put to good use. Algorithmic trading is an old field where stocks are traded with the help of algorithms to achieve better returns and reinforcement learning based financial systems can optimize the returns from stocks further.

 ### Online Recommendation
 Online recommendations to provide personalized user experience have proven to be game-changers for many online companies.

 Reinforcement Learning is being also considered a useful tool for improving online recommendations. Reinforcement learning can take into account factors of both seller and buyer for training purposes and the results have been beyond expectations.

 ### Marketing Strategies
 Now with the recent popularity of reinforcement learning, researchers from New York University have come up with a unique algorithm, known as Inverse Reinforcement Learning. This algorithm helps in predicting the reaction of the customers in-advance by simulating the changes

## Advantages
- Maximize the performance
- Sustain change for long period of time.
- Reinforcement learning can be used to solve very complex problems that cannot be solved by conventional techniques.
- This technique is preferred to achieve long-term results, which are very difficult to achieve.
- This learning model is very similar to the learning of human beings. Hence, it is close to achieving perfection.
- The model can correct the errors that occurred during the training process.
- Once an error is corrected by the model, the chances of occurring the same error are very less
- It can create the perfect model to solve a particular problem.
- Robots can implement reinforcement learning algorithms to learn how to walk.

## Disadvantages 
- too much of reinforcement can lead to overloads of states. which can diminish the results.
- Reinforcement learning is not preferable to use for solving simple problems.
- Reinforcement learning needs a lot of data and a lot of computation
- It is data-hungry

## Types of Reinforcement

### Positive
Positive Reinforcement is defined as when an event, occurs due to a particular behavior, increases the strength and the frequency of the behavior. 

In other words, it has a positive effect on behavior.

### Negative
 Negative Reinforcement is defined as strengthening of a behavior because a negative condition is stopped or avoided.
