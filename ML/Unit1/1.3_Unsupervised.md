## Unsupervised Learning
It is also known as Data Driven learning.
In unsupervised learning data has no labels. You are unsure about output.
It allows much larger datasets to be worked on by the program.

In Unsupervised learning we mainly learn about **clustering** and **Dimensional Reduction**.

**Example** - Self learning science book by student.

## More theory points
1. In supervised learning, the labels allow the algorithm to find the exact nature of the relationship between any two data points
2. used to draw inferences from datasets
3. The most common unsupervised learning method is cluster analysis.
4. A type of algorithm that learns patterns from unlabeled data

## Applications

### Clustering
Clustering is the process of grouping the given data into different clusters or groups. Unsupervised learning can be used to do clustering when we don’t know exactly the information about the clusters.\

### Visualization
Visualization is the process of creating diagrams, images, graphs, charts, etc., to communicate some information. 
This method can be applied using unsupervised machine learning.

### Finding Association Rules
This is the process of finding associations between different parameters in the available data. It discovers the probability of the co-occurrence of items in a collection, such as people that buy X also tend to buy Y.

### Anomaly Detection
Anomaly detection is the identification of rare items, events, or observations, which brings suspicions by differing significantly from the normal data.

### Dimensionality Reduction
Dimensionality reduction is the process of reducing the number of random variables under consideration by getting a set of principal variables.\
Many machine learning problems contain thousands of features for each training instance. This will make the training slow, and it will be difficult to obtain a proper solution to the problem.

## Advantages of unsupervised learning
- It can handle large dataset effectively.
- Labeling of data not required.
- Time saving.
  
## Disadvantages
- No way of obtaining the way or method tha data is stored.
- They may be less accurate as the input data is known.
