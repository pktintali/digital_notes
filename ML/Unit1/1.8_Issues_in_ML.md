## Issues in Machine Learning
- Focusing Too Much on Algorithms and Theories
- Mastering ALL of Machine Learning
- Having Bad Data Convert to Bad Results
  
### Data Quality
The most common issue when using ML is poor data quality.
The adage is true: garbage in, garbage out. It is essential to have good quality data to produce quality ML algorithms and models.

### Transparency
The most common issue I find to be is the lack of model transparency.

### Manpower
Having data and being able to use it so does not introduce bias into the model. How organizations change how they think about software development and how they collect and use data. Make sure they have enough skillsets in the organization.
