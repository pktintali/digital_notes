## Well Defined Learning Problems
A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P,\
if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.
## Example
A checkers learning problem

**Task T** -> Playing checkers\
**Performance Measure P** -> % of games won against opponents.\
**Training Experience E** ->playing practice game against itself.

In general to have well defined learning problem, We must identify these 3 features -

 - the class of task (T),
 - the measure of performance to be improved (P),
 - and the source of experience(E).
