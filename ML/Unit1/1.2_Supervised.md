## Supervised Learning
It is the task driven learning where we have labeled data. In supervised learning we know that what input needs to be mapped to what output.

In supervised learning we generally learn about **regression** and **classification**.

**Example** - teaching a little baby about apples.

## More theory points 
1. Supervised learning is one of the most basic types of machine learning.
2. In this type, the machine learning algorithm is trained on labeled data.
3. It is highly focused on a singular task.
4. In supervised learning, the ML algorithm is given a small training dataset to work with.
5. It is very similar to teaching a child with the use of flash cards.

## Applications

### Spam Classification
If you use a modern email system, chances are you’ve encountered a spam filter. That spam filter is a supervised learning system.

### Face Recognition
Do you use Facebook? Most likely your face has been used in a supervised learning algorithm that is trained to recognize your face. Having a system that takes a photo, finds faces, and guesses who that is in the photo (suggesting a tag) is a supervised process.

### Advertisement Popularity
Selecting advertisements that will perform well is often a supervised learning task. Many of the ads you see as you browse the internet are placed there because a learning algorithm said that they were of reasonable popularity (and clickability).

## Advantages of supervised learning
- You will have an exact idea about the classes in the training data.
- Supervised learning is a simple process to understand.
- You can find out exactly how many classes are there before giving the data for training.
- After the entire training is completed, you don’t necessarily need to keep the training data in your memory
- Supervised learning can be very helpful in classification problems.
  
## Disadvantages of supervised learning
- Large computation time
- Preprocessing of data is always a challenge
- Unwanted data could reduce the accuracy.
- If dataset is incorrect your algorithm learn incorrectly that can bring losses.
- It can’t handle some of the complex tasks in machine learning.
- It cannot cluster or classify data by discovering its features on its own.
- We can not always give lots of information with supervision
