## History of ML
- The term Machine Learning (ML) was first used by Arthur Samuel, one of the pioneers of Artificial Intelligence at IBM, in 1959.
-  The name came from researchers who observed computers recognizing patterns and developed the theory that computers could learn without being programmed to perform specific tasks.
-  They began exploring artificial intelligence to see how capable computers were of learning from data.
- ML began to pick up speed in 90â€™s, when it separated from Artificial Intelligence and become its own unique field rooted in statistical modeling and probability theory.
