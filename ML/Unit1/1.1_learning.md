## What is Learning ?
Learning is any process in which any system improves performance from experience.
It is a part of Artificial Intelligence.
### Examples -
- Image Recognition
- Speech Recognition
- Classification
- Prediction
- Recommendation
- Robotics
- Social networks 
- Debugging software
- Web search
## ML is used when
- Human expertise does not exist (navigating on Mars) 
- Humans canâ€™t explain their expertise (speech recognition)
- Models must be customized (personalized medicine)
- Models are based on huge amounts of data

## Types of Machine Learning
Mainly machine learning is divided into three parts -
1. Supervised Learning
2. Unsupervised Learning
3. Reinforcement Learning
