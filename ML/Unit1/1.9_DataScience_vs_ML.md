## Data Science
- It is the complex study of the large amounts of data in a company or organizations repository.
- This study includes where the data has originated from,
- the actual study of its content matter,
- and how this data can be useful for the growth of the company in the future.

## Machine Learning
- Machine Learning is a field of study that gives computers the capability to learn without being explicitly programmed.
- Machine learning is applied using Algorithms to process the data and get trained for delivering future predictions without human intervention.
- The inputs for Machine Learning is the set of instructions or data or observations.
- Machine Learning is used extensively by companies like Facebook, Google, etc.
