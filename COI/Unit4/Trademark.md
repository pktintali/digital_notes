# Trademark
In India, trademarks are protected both under statutory law and common law. 

In addition to trademarks, the following categories of marks can also be registered under the TM Act.

1. ### Certification marks -
   are given for compliance with defined standards, but are not confined to any membership. Such marks are granted to anyone who can certify that the products involved meet certain established standards. The internationally accepted “ISO 9000” quality standard is an example of a widely recognized certification mark.
2. ### Collective marks -
   can be owned by any association. The members of such associations will be allowed to use the collective mark to identify themselves with a level of quality and other requirements and standards set by the association. Examples of such associations would be those representing accountants, engineers or architects.

## Trademark Registration Process
1. Identification & selection of the mark.
2. Pre application search.
3. Filing of the application.
4. Application numbering.
5. Clarifying examination.
6. Advertise the application.
7. Acceptance of the application.
8. Issue of the registration certificate.

If the Registrar of Trademarks is satisfied with the reason, the examination of the application is expedited and the examination report is issued within three months of the date of such request. If such a request is rejected after the hearing, the fee paid is refunded.
