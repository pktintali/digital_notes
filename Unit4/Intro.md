# INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY (IP)

## Definition
- Intellectual property (IP) is a **term** referring to a brand, invention, design or other kind of creation
- which a person or business **has legal rights over**
- Almost all businesses own some form of IP, which could be a business asset.

## Common types of IP 
- ### Copyright-
  This protects **written or published works** such as books, songs, films, web content and artistic works
- ### Patents - 
  This protects **commercial inventions**, for example, a new business product or process
- ### Designs -
  This protects **designs**, such as drawings or computer models
- ### Trade marks -
  this protects **signs, symbols, logos, words or sounds** that distinguish your products and services from those of your competitors.

>### IP can be either registered or           unregistered.

## Registered IP
Registered rights are **granted by appropriate government bodies**, and have to be applied for.
If you do not do this, others are free to exploit your creations  It is generally **necessary to pay government fees**, and to incur cost in securing professional advice, to secure and maintain such rights.

## Unregistered IP
Unregistered rights **arise automatically without the need for registration** with any government body, but are **generally weaker than registered rights.** Unregistered forms of IP include copyright, unregistered design rights, common law trade marks and database rights, confidential information and trade secrets. 

## Some Important Points
- India has been a World Trade Organization (WTO) member since **1995**.
- WTO member nations **must include** some IP 
  protection in their national laws

## India is also a signatory to the following international IP agreements

- ### Paris Convention -
  Under this, **any person from a signatory state can apply for a patent** or trade mark in any other signatory state, and **will be given the same enforcement rights** and status **as a national of that country would be**.
- ### Berne Convention - 
  Under this, each member state recognizes the copyright of authors from other member states in the same way as the copyright of its own nationals.
- ### Madrid Protocol -
  Under this, a person can file **a single trade mark application at their national** office that will **provide protection in multiple countries**.
- ### Patent Cooperation Treaty -
  This is a central system for **obtaining a ‘bundle’ of national patent** applications in different jurisdictions **through a single application**.

## Important Points on Patents
- Patents are valid for **20 years** from the date of filing an application, subject to an annual renewal fee
- India’s patent law operates under the **first to file** principle – that is, if two people apply for a patent on an identical invention, the first one to file the application will be awarded the patent.
- India’s Patents Act of 1970, 2003 Patent Rules and the 2016 Patent Amendment Rules set out the law concerning patents.

## Important Points on Copyrights
- Registration is made, in person or via a representative, with the Copyright Office.
- All IPRs are now administered by the Department for Industrial Property and Promotion (DIPP).
  
## Important Points on Design
- The laws governing designs are the Designs Act 2000 and the Designs Rules 2001. 
- Designs are valid for a maximum of ten years, renewable for a further five years.

## Important Points on Trade marks
- India’s trade mark laws consist of the 1999 Trade Marks Act and the Trade Marks Rules of 2002 and 2017
- The regulatory authority for patents is the Controller General of Patents, Designs and Trade Marks under the Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion. 
- The police now have more robust powers in enforcing trade mark law

## Registration
To enjoy most types of intellectual property (IP) rights in India, you should register them.
- For **patents**, individual registrations must be made in India, but **for rights** other than industrial designs you can apply under the terms of the Patent Cooperation Treaty, which is usually easier and quicker.
- For **trade marks**, you should register them **within India**, either through the **domestic trade mark system** or under the Madrid system.
- **For copyright**, no registration is required but registering copyrights with the copyright authorities **is advisable**.

## Enforcement
- IP rights **can be enforced** by bringing actions to the **civil courts** or through **criminal prosecution**.
- India’s IP laws set out procedures for **both civil and criminal proceedings**, as does the Competition Act.
- Criminal proceedings do not apply to patent and design infringements.
  
## Suggestions
There are various things you can do to make it harder in general for **infringers to copy your product**. For example, you could:
- Think about the design of your product, and how easy it would be for somebody to reproduce it without seeing your original designs.
- Have sound physical protection and destruction methods for documents, drawings, tooling, samples, machinery etc.
- Make sure there are no ‘leakages’ of packaging that might be used by counterfeiters to pass off fake product
- Check production over-runs to make sure that genuine product is not being sold under a different name.
